# A fixpoint is a snapshot of the database contents.
# It is saved to the +spec/fixpoints+ folder.
# A fixpoint (file) contains a mapping of table names to a list if their records.
#
# Empty tables are stripped from files.
#
# Make sure to run the tests in the right order: In a single RSpec file, you can use the order in which the tests are defined (`RSpec.describe 'MyFeature', order: :defined do`).
# However, tests in groups might follow a slightly different order (see https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/configuration/overriding-global-ordering)
#
# If you did a lot of changes to a test, you can remove a fixpoint file from its directory.
# It will be recreated when the test producing it runs again.
# Don't forget re-running the tests _based on_ it because their fixpoints might have to change too.
# Example: You need to add something to the database's seeds.rb. All subsequent fixpoints are missing the required entry.
# To update all fixpoints, just remove the whole `spec/fixpoints` folder and re-run all tests. Now all fixpoints should be updated.
# Be careful though, don't just remove the fixpoints if you are not sure what is going on.
# A change in a fixpoint might point to an unintended change in code.
#
# We need to be be careful to use +let+ and +let!+ with factories.
# Records might be created twice when using create in there (once by the fixpoint and once by the factory).
#
# KNOWN ISSUES
# Under certain conditions you may get `duplicate key value violates unique constraint` because the primary key sequences are not updated correctly.
# If this happens, just add a Fixpoint.reset_pk_sequences! at the beginning of your test. We need to dig a little deeper here at some point...
#
# LIMITATIONS
# The records in tables are ordered by their id.
# If there is no id for a table, we use database's order (what the SELECT query returns).
# This order may be instable.
